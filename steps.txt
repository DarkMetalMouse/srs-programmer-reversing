I connected the srs programmer to a servo through a splitter cable and connected the signal and ground to my logic analyzer

I saw that whenever I press one of the interesting buttons (LEFT, PROGRAM, RIGHT in programming mode), I get a packet.

I determined that the width of each bit is 13us, so I decoded the bits by hand with excel.

I realized that each packet is made of a 10 bit frame with the first bit always 0 and the last always 1.

Knowing this, I felt I was finally able to write a program that decodes the packets automatically from an export capture.

After doing a sequence of {RIGHT (success), LEFT (success), PROGRAM (success)} I got dump1.txt.

There I saw that every packet starts with FF FF and then 7F if the packet is from the programmer or 80 if it's from the servo

I also saw that the packet sent when LEFT or RIGHT are pressed are the same.

I did another dump of the same sequence but setting different limits (dump2.txt) and ran a diff.

I found some differences in the big packet sent to the programmer when PROGRAM is pressed.

More notably, I found that the last 3 bits of the response to RIGHT/LEFT changed, which probably means they contain the servo's position.
